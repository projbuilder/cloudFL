### Navigate to Demo
```
http://localhost:8083/demo
```

### Tab 1: PDF → Course (5 minutes demo time)

**What to say:**
> "This demonstrates AI-powered content transformation. I'll upload a real PDF textbook and you'll see Gemini AI analyze it in real-time."

**What to do:**
1. Click **"Choose PDF"** or drag-drop any educational PDF (5-50 pages works best)
2. Click **"Transform with AI"**

**What happens (LIVE):**
- ✅ PDF uploads to Supabase Storage

- The key takeaways (extracted by AI)

**Talking points:**
- "This is NOT fake data - it's making actual API calls to Gemini"
- "The AI rewrites dense textbook content into student-friendly modules"
- "Each module gets a 768-dimensional embedding for semantic search"
- "Cost: ~$0.50-2 per textbook with Gemini's pricing"

---

### Tab 2: AI Tutor (RAG) (3 minutes demo time)

**What to say:**
> "Now that we have content, let's see Retrieval Augmented Generation in action. This isn't just chatting with AI - it's searching our specific course content."

**What to do:**
1. Click suggested question OR type: "What is Federated Learning?"
2. Wait for response

**What happens (LIVE):**
- ✅ Question → Gemini embedding-001 (768-dim vector)
- ✅ pgvector cosine similarity search in Supabase
- ✅ Top 3 relevant sections retrieved
- ✅ Context + question → Gemini Pro
- ✅ Contextual answer generated
- ✅ Conversation saved to database

**Show them:**
- The "Retrieved from X sources via pgvector" message
- Try another question to show it maintains context

**Talking points:**
- "This is RAG - not just generic AI responses"
- "It searches YOUR content using vector similarity"
- "pgvector extension in PostgreSQL handles the math"
- "Answers are grounded in your course material"

**Try these questions:**
- "What is Federated Learning?"
- "How does FL preserve privacy?"
- "What are the main challenges?"
- "Explain differential privacy in simple terms"

---

### Tab 3: Adaptive Quiz (4 minutes demo time)

**What to say:**
> "This quiz adapts to student performance in real-time. Questions are AI-generated from the module content."

**What to do:**
1. Take the quiz (answer 2-3 questions wrong intentionally)
2. Complete all 5 questions

**What happens (LIVE):**
- ✅ Quiz generated by Gemini from module content
- ✅ Difficulty tracked (easy/medium/hard)
- ✅ Your answers recorded to database
- ✅ Score calculated
- ✅ Adaptive algorithm decides next difficulty

**Show them:**
- The AI-generated questions (real, not fake!)
- The explanations for correct answers
- The adaptive feedback at the end

**Talking points:**
- "Questions are generated by Gemini, not pre-written"
- "Score ≥90% → increases difficulty"
- "Score <50% → decreases difficulty"
- "This personalizes the learning path per student"

---

### Tab 4: FL Simulation (2 minutes demo time)

**What to say:**
> "This visualizes how Federated Learning works with multiple devices training locally while preserving privacy."

**What happens (LIVE):**
- ✅ Real-time animation of 4 device nodes
- ✅ Status changes: training → aggregating → syncing
- ✅ Global accuracy increasing
- ✅ Privacy score: always 100%

**Talking points:**
- "Each device trains on local data (never shared)"
- "Only model updates go to the server"
- "Central server aggregates without seeing raw data"
- "In production, this would use TensorFlow.js in the browser"

## 📊 WHAT TO SHOW IN SUPABASE DASHBOARD

### During Demo, Show:

1. **Table Editor** → `course_modules`:
   - Real modules created from PDF
   - See the AI-generated content

2. **Table Editor** → `course_embeddings`:
   - 768-dimensional vectors (scroll right)
   - Proof of vector storage

3. **Table Editor** → `chat_messages`:
   - Your conversations with AI tutor
   - User and assistant messages

4. **Table Editor** → `quizzes`:
   - Generated quiz questions (as JSON)

5. **Storage** → `course-materials`:
   - Your uploaded PDFs

---

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### PDF upload fails
- **Check**: Is storage bucket `course-materials` created and PUBLIC?
- **Check**: Is Gemini API key in `.env`?
- **Check**: Browser console for specific errors

### AI Tutor says "couldn't generate response"
- **Check**: Gemini API key correct in `.env`
- **Check**: At least one module exists (upload PDF first)
- **Try**: Suggested questions first (they always work)

### Quiz generation fails
- **Check**: Module exists in database
- **Check**: Gemini API key valid
- **Check**: Browser console for API errors

### Vector search not working
- **Check**: SQL ran successfully (pgvector extension enabled)
- **Check**: Embeddings table has data
- **Fallback**: System uses regular content search if vector fails

---

## 🎓 Q&A PREPARATION

### Q: "Is this using real AI or is it mocked?"
**A:** "100% real. Open the Network tab - you'll see actual calls to generativelanguage.googleapis.com. I can show you the API costs in my Google AI Studio dashboard."

### Q: "How does the vector search work?"
**A:** "Questions are converted to 768-dim embeddings with Gemini. pgvector (PostgreSQL extension) uses cosine similarity to find relevant content. Then Gemini generates answers using that context. It's pure RAG architecture."

### Q: "Can this scale to production?"
**A:** "Yes. Supabase handles millions of rows, pgvector is production-grade, Gemini has rate limits but can be upgraded. The architecture is serverless so it auto-scales. I'd add caching for common queries and batch embedding generation."

### Q: "What about FL implementation?"
**A:** "The visualization shows the concept. For production, we'd use TensorFlow.js to train models in the browser, send gradients to the server, and use FedAvg for aggregation. The database schema supports it - I have a `student_profiles` table ready for local model versions."

### Q: "How much did this cost to build?"
**A:** "Development: Free. Testing: ~$2 in Gemini API calls. Running demo: Free (Gemini free tier gives 60 requests/minute). Production would be ~$0.50-2 per textbook + ~$0.01 per tutor conversation."
